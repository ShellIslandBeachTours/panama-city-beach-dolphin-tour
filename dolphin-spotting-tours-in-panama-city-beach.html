<div><p>Shell Island, St Andrews Bay and the Gulf of Mexico are exciting and new experiences every time you visit. The whole family can enjoy snorkeling in the shallows and grass flats of the island. For a personalized wildlife adventure, we offer both small-group and private tours. This tour offers it all! Family fun is our specialty and we have been doing it for more than 30 years.</p><p>Dolphins do not have gills like fish. Dolphins must breathe oxygen from the air, but they also need to remain in the water. The dolphin can stay in the water while taking in oxygen by jumping out of it. To have fun, increase visibility, remove parasites and improve navigation, dolphins leap out of the water.</p><p>Henderson Beach State Park, Destin, Florida.

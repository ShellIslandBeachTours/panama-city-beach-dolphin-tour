<div><p>It is illegal to swim with wild dolphins on the Florida coast. According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission "It is against federal laws to feed or harass wild Dolphins." Additionally, dolphins that swim with humans are more likely to be injured during interactions with humans.</p><p>Ancient Greeks related stories about dolphins protecting sailors. It even happened in an episode of Flipper. This is why people love it so much. <b>Shoreline</b>  There is no reliable evidence to support this idea.</p><p>May, June and Juli are the best months of the year to observe dolphins off the Azores coasts in Ireland, Egypt and Madeira.</p></div>

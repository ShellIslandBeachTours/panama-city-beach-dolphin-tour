Jumping from the water allows dolphins to be dry and take in oxygen. <i>Review</i>  Dolphins leap from the water to enjoy, to enhance visibility, to remove parasites or improve navigation.</p><p>According to officials, tannins are formed when organic matter such as pine needles, leaves and grasses get into water. <b>Waves</b>  They then break down over time giving the water a dark tea-colored appearance.</p></div>

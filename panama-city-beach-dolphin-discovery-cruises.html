Dolphins are often drawn to the wake of a boat, which causes a disturbance on the surface of the water. <i>Photography</i>  They will jump out of the water and appear to be playing in the wake when they do this.</p><p>All guests can use the swim vests and/or suits provided by Discovery Cove. Discovery Cove guests must not wear jewelry. This is to protect the animals.</p>

They can be outstripped by any other predator.</p><p>California, USA. Southern California's coastline is home for one of the highest numbers of dolphins in the entire world. Here are common dolphins such as bottlenose dolphins.</p><p>Some coastal dolphins that live in higher latitudes tend to migrate more south in the winter, while others travel farther north in the summer. For example, coast bottlenose dolphins in the Atlantic region of the U. S. move seasonally between New Jersey or North Carolina.</p> <b>Fun</b></div>

<div><p>How to interact with wild dolphins. Dolphins are able to eat many sea creatures, including fish, crustaceans and squid. <i>Shoreline</i>  However, other foods are not allowed. Don't touch dolphins. <i>Joyfulness</i>  Learn the laws. ... Keep an eye out for signs of behavioral problems.</p><p>Although dolphins are generally gentle, they can get angry at times. They can be loud and agitated by their jaws, or their tails, making it hard to get the water. Dolphins can be very helpful.</p><p>Shell Island is home for a large population of bottlenose Dolphins. On one of our Panama Beach Dolphin Tours, you can see these magnificent marine mammals in their natural habitat.</p></div>

<div><p>The Gulf of Mexico is home to marine mammals such as dolphins, whales, and one species of sirenian, the West Indian Manatee (Trichechusmanatus). No sea lions (fur seals), seals, or seagoing otters are found in the Gulf of Mexico as they are elsewhere.</p><p>Although you may have seen dolphins in captivity in a marine park or aquarium, it is much more fascinating to see these magnificent animals in their natural habitat.

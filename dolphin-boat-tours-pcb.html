<div> <p>Panama City Beach is just east from Destin on Hwy 98. These beaches have been voted the best in the country. <i>Shoreline</i>  The St. Andrew Bay filters large amounts of sediment out and there is virtually no runoff from rivers in the area.</p><p>Dolphins don't swim with people, "kiss", or tow people in the water because it is fun. They do this because they have to. These are not natural behaviors and all captive dolphins are trained to perform them correctly. If they don't, they won't eat.</p><p>Panama City Beach and Bay County are great places to snorkel and swim, and offer great alternatives to the Gulf of Mexico.</p></div>

Dolphin behavior is affected by many factors, including the weather conditions, tide cycles, water temperatures, tides, availability of prey, and other environmental factors. There is a good chance to see dolphins whenever the sun is shining and the waters are clear. Feeding activities usually take place on an outgoing tide. Panama Beach Dolphin Tours is a great option. They are on the water almost every day of year.</p></div>

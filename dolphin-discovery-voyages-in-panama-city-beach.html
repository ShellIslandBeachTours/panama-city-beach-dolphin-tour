"text": "Dolphinaria might have you believe that dolphins are not apex predators of the ocean. They can kill sharks and should be treated accordingly. The aggressive nature of dolphins can make them dangerous to humans, other dolphins and even cause self-harm. The majority of dolphins found in the United States are kept in captivity. However, they are not domesticated."

<div><p>Panama City Beach in Florida is the best place to swim alongside dolphins. Panama City is home to many wild dolphins, but there are also marine parks where dolphins are equally excited to see you.</p><p>1. <i>Memory</i>  Killer whale (Orcinus Orca) While we think of orcas living in colder areas, about 500 orcas are found in the Gulf of Mexico, where they eat tuna and dolphins in deep waters that are often far from land.</p><p>Discovery Cove, an all-inclusive resort, offers you and your family a unique opportunity to swim with dolphins. You can also snorkel with thousands upon thousands of tropical fish rays. Hand-feed exotic birds. Relax on unspoiled beaches. The park is open to all, so you can take your time and plan your adventure.</p> <i>Joyfulness</i></div>

<div><p>Dolphinaria will have you believe other than what they actually are, but dolphins can be apex ocean predators and capable of killing sharks. <b>Family</b>  You should treat them as such. You may find dolphins aggressive towards other dolphins or self-harm.
